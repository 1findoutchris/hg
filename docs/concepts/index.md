- [**Prize Distribution**](./prize-distribution): A statistical approach to distribute prizes to many users across many chains.

- [**Time-Weighted Average Balance**](./time-weighted-average-balance): A TWAB is a user's balance at any time in the past, or their average balance held between two timestamps.

- [**Computing Prizes**](./computing-prizes): Computing prizes is an calculation intensive process done off chain. Prizes are hten submitted to the contract for verification when claiming.
