If a prize savings network is an archipelago, then the islands are Prize Pools.

A prize savings network is made up of multiple Prize Pools, each of which holds user deposits in non-custodial, non-upgradeable contract that contributes yield to the network. Prize Pools are the main entry points for users.

Prize Pools can differ by:

- yield source (Compound, Aave, Yearn etc)
- blockchain (Ethereum, Polygon, etc)
- asset (USDC, Dai, etc)

Prize pools that are part of the same network all contribute yield to a combined prize.  This prize is then distributed fairly across all prize pools.

This allows prize pools to have huge headline prizes, whether they have significant liquidity or not.
