In order for PoolTogether to work, a random number is required to choose winners and complete draws. PoolTogether V5 incentivizes anyone looking to request and relay random numbers from a trusted and verifiable RNG service. 

Draws are daily, which means:

- there is `1` `startRngRequest` that needs to take place (typically on an L1 such as Ethereum mainnet) each day
- there is `n` number of `relay` transactions that need to take place for `n` number of prize pools

Prize pools typically live on L2s as it is much cheaper for poolers to deposit and withdraw on L2s. In these cases, the `relay` transaction will also bridge the RNG from the source (eg. Ethereum) to the destination (eg. Optimism).

### To earn from completing draw auctions you will need to:

1. [Check to see if there are open auctions](#1-list-active-accounts)
2. [Compute the rewards that can be earned, and the costs associated](#2-compute-winning-tiers)
3. [If completing an auction is profitable, execute a transaction to complete it](#3-batch-prize-claims)
