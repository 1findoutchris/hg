In order for PoolTogether to work, a random number is required to choose winners and complete draws. PoolTogether V5 incentivizes anyone looking to request and relay random numbers from a trusted and verifiable RNG service. 

Draws are daily, which means:

- there is `1` `startRngRequest` that needs to take place (typically on an L1 such as Ethereum mainnet) each day
- there is `n` number of `relay` transactions that need to take place for `n` number of prize pools

Prize pools typically live on L2s as it is much cheaper for poolers to deposit and withdraw on L2s. In these cases, the `relay` transaction will also bridge the RNG from the source (eg. Ethereum) to the destination (eg. Optimism).

### To earn from completing draw auctions you will need to:

1. [Check to see if there are open auctions](#1-list-active-accounts)
2. [Compute the rewards that can be earned, and the costs associated](#2-compute-winning-tiers)
3. [If completing an auction is profitable, execute a transaction to complete it](#3-batch-prize-claims)

### 1. Check For Open Auctions

#### RngAuction

You can use `isAuctionOpen` on the **RngAuction** contract to test if the auction is open and can be completed.

#### RngRelayAuction

Finding out if the **RngRelayAuction** is open is a bit more complicated due to it being based on the previous **RngAuction**. It also has an `isAuctionOpen` function however this it requires two parameters: `isAuctionOpen(_sequenceId, _rngCompletedAt)`.

`_sequenceId` can be found by querying **RngAuction** for `lastSequenceId()`.

`_rngCompletedAt` can be found by querying **RngAuction** for `getRngResults()`. This returns two values: the `randomNumber` and `rngCompletedAt`.


### 2. Compute Rewards and Costs

#### RngAuction

The **RngAuction** requires we find the values of **ETH** (for gas costs), **LINK** (for RNG costs), and **POOL** (for reward value). We'll focus on the PoolTogether-specific values for LINK and POOL here.



#### RngRelayAuction

The **RngRelayAuction** only requires us to know the values of **ETH** (for gas) and **POOL** (for rewards) to determine profitability.


### 3. Completing an Auction
