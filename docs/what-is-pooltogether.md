## Protocol, Interface, Labs

- **PoolTogether Labs**: The company which developed the PoolTogether protocol, along with the web interface.
- **The PoolTogether Protocol**: A suite of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts that together create an automated market maker, a protocol that facilitates peer-to-peer market making and swapping of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **The PoolTogether Interface**: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the PoolTogether protocol. The interface is only one of many ways one may interact with the PoolTogether protocol.
- **PoolTogether Governance**: A governance system for governing the PoolTogether Protocol, enabled by the UNI token.
